# FractionalErlangQueue
Repository for the simulation of the Fractional Erlang Queue

Description of the files: MLgen.R contains the function for the generation of a vector of Mittag-Leffler random variables; Erlangsimclassic.R contains the function for the simulation of a classical Erlang queue; Erlangsimfrac.R contains the function for the simulation of a fractional Erlang queue; Figure1.R and Figure2.R are some applications of these functions.

To use the functions, the package "stabledist" is needed. Moreover, to use the function in Erlangsimfrac.R, it is necessary to import first MLgen.R.
